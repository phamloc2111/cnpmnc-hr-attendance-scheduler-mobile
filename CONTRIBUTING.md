# Development workflow

Use the existing shared branches in this order:

1. Start from the latest `dev`, bring `feat` up to date, and implement the feature on `feat`.
2. Commit with a descriptive prefix and push `feat`.
3. When the feature is complete, open a **GitHub Pull Request from `feat` to `dev`**. Review the complete diff, run the repository checks, inspect configured CI/status checks, address review comments, and resolve every merge conflict. Merge through the PR only after the required checks and review requirements are satisfied.
4. Verify the merged feature on `dev`. Make fixes on `feat` and submit them through another PR to `dev`.
5. Once `dev` is verified, open a **GitHub Pull Request from `dev` to `main`**. Check the complete diff, current mergeability, conflicts, review comments, and all configured checks again. Merge through the PR only after validation is complete.
6. Synchronize local branches from the remote after the PR is merged. Bring `feat` up to date from `dev` before starting the next feature.

**Never merge locally into `dev` or `main` and push those branches directly. Both promotion steps require a GitHub Pull Request, even when local tests already pass.** Pending, failed, or stale required checks do not count as passing. Validate the latest PR commit after any changes.

If CI is not configured, run the relevant local checks and record the results in the PR; do not claim that GitHub checks ran. If PR creation, inspection, or merging is unavailable, report that limitation and keep the work on `feat`; never fall back to a direct push to `dev` or `main`.

Do not force-push shared branches. Keep `hotfix` and `release` separate from this normal feature flow.

Example commit messages:

- `[UPDATE] Add employee account management`
- `[UPDATE] Update mobile login UI`
- `[FIX] Hide scheduling fields for management roles`
- `[TEST] Cover account permissions and session revocation`
- `[DOCS] Document account setup and API contracts`
- `[MERGE] Merge completed feature into dev`
- `[MERGE] Promote tested dev to main`

Never commit real `.env` files, credentials, access tokens, signing keys, or build outputs. Keep fake test credentials clearly confined to tests and examples.

## Mobile checks

```powershell
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

Do not build APKs as part of routine unit/widget verification. Build or run on a device when platform validation is requested and the local environment has sufficient disk space.

Configure the API with `--dart-define=API_BASE_URL=...`. Tokens must use secure storage. Platform changes require Android/iOS verification on a supported environment; iOS requires macOS.

The conventions are packaged in `.codex/skills/hr-attendance-mobile.skill`.
